= Undertow Blocking

Sample project that demonstrates the following scenario:

- /accounts receives a request
- the HttpHandler bundled as library on /accounts makes a request to /auth
- this request blocks, and no request is "received" on the /auth side
- once the request times out, the /auth side "receives" the request

"Receives" and "received" is defined here as: the /auth side doesn't processes incoming requests, as if the HttpHandler
were "blocking" the incoming requests.

How to reproduce:

- put a breakpoint on library/AgentHttpHandler, on the following line:

    statusCode = connection.getResponseCode(); // blocks here, and throws a read timeout exception

- run

    $ curl -v http://localhost:8080/hawkular-undertow-accounts/v1/accounts
